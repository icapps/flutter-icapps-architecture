### Custom Error handling
#### Localized error
This error can be used to map a localization key/localization to an Exception. So when the exception is thrown you don't have to do an extra mapping to get the correct text.

#### Network Error
A NetworkError is used simplify the DioErrors. A NetworkError is also a LocalizedError so it is easy to get the correct localization/localizationKey

### Extensions

#### Context
- `bool isAndroidTheme` (Returns true if the current theme is targeting the android platform)
- `bool isIOSTheme` (Returns true if the current theme is targeting the ios platform)
- `bool isTablet` (Returns true if the device indicates it is a tablet.)
- `bool isLandscape` (Returns true if the device indicates it is in landscape mode.)

#### MediaQueryData
- `bool isTablet` (Returns true if the device indicates it is a tablet.)
- `bool isLandscap` (Returns true if the device indicates it is in landscape mode.)

#### Iterable<T>
- `int count(bool Function(T) where)` (Counts all elements for which [where] returns true)
- `E sum<E extends num>(E Function(T) valueProducer)` (Sums the result of [valueProvider] for each item)
- `T? find(bool Function(T) where)` (Finds the first item that matches [where], if no such item could be found)
- `bool all(bool Function(T) where)` (Returns `true` if every item matches [where])
- `Map<S, T> associateBy<S>(S Function(T) key)` (Create a map by mapping every element using [key]. Duplicate values discarded)
- `Tuple2<List<T>, List<T>> split(bool Function(T) on)` (Splits the elements according to [on]. Items for which [on] is true will be stored in [Tuple2.item1], other items in [Tuple2.item2])
- `Iterable<R> mapIndexed<R>(R Function(int, T) mapper)` (Same as [Iterable.map] except that the [mapper] function also receives the index of the item being mapped)
- `void forEachIndexed(Function(int, T) f)` (Same as [Iterable.foreach] except that the [f] function also receives the index of the item)
- `Iterable<K> mapNotNull<K>(K? Function(T) f)` (Same as [Iterable.map] except that the [f] function can return `null` and the resulting iterable will not contain `null` values)

##### Iterable<Iterable<T>>

#### List<T>

- `void sortBy<R>(Comparable<R>? by(T item), {bool ascending = true})` (Sorts the list based on the comparable returned by [by]. By default the sorting is [ascending])
- `void sortBy2<R, V>( Comparable<R>? by(T item), Comparable<V>? by2(T item), {bool ascending = true})` (Sorts the list by comparing first comparing using [by] and if the items are equal, by comparing them using [by2]. By default the sorting is [ascending])

#### Map<K?,V>
- `Map<K, V> removeNullKeys()` (Removes all null keys from the map)

#### Map<K,V?>
- `Map<K, V> removeNullValues()` (Removes all null values from the map)

Added the AfterLayout implementation in our plugin

### Provider
- `BaseProviderWidget` is a widget that can be used to easily generate the viewmodels for your screen.
The `create` function will be used to create your viewmodel
`themeLookup` will be used to get your theme
`localizationLookup` will be used to get your localization implementation

- `BaseThemeProviderWidget` In some cases you need your theme or localizations you can use this in combination with the right builder function to get just that.

### Caching
`SingleValueCache<T>` can be used to cache single values
`KeyValueCache<T>` can be sed to cache values by key
